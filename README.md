## Mean, Median, Range

This program finds the mean, median, and range of a lower bound, upper bound, and step counter user input.

### Input

The input is a user input for a lower bound, upper bound, and step counter. 

### Expected Output

The expected output is the mean, median, and range

### Execution

This program is executed sequentially. First it computes the Mean, then the Median, and finally the Range. There are no conditional statements (unless we consider the else statements)

### Improvements

This code could be improved via adding in additional functions. Finding the Mode would be useful. Incorporating more user errors as well as having a greater variety of UI would be helpful as well.



## Convert Message to ASCII from Integer String

This program decodes messages to ASCII characters based off of a predetermined integer string.

### Input

The input is an integer string. The numbers can be positive or negative.

### Expected Output

The expected output is the ASCII character string.

### Execution

This is a python script. It defines a function called decode that calls on the string at the very bottom of the code.

### Improvements

Adding in an interactive input that allows for multiple strings at the same time would be an interesting addition. This would improve quality of life issues as well as increase efficiency and optimization.
